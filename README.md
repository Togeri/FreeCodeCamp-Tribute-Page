# FreeCodeCamp-Tribute-Page
This is the 2nd challenge of FCC - A Portfolio Page.
I'm having some trouble trying to to build some "responsive behavior":

- On PC: Header logos are shown in Grey color, and when you put the mouse on it, .hoover subclass gives them their propper colors (had to look after them on several design pages, but it was worth it to make my idea come to life and see how it worked)
- On Smartphone: As there's no .hoover subclass on mobile devices, I want the responsive version of the webpage to show the icons colored instead of grey on the first place. 
  
  Still have to figure out how. ANY suggestion would be really appreciated!

Of course, I've been learning how to code for just a week or so, so I've got to peace myself, but still... haha
